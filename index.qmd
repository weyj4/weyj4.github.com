title: "A Minimal Quarto Demo"

## Why this exists

This is a deliberately small Quarto site to demonstrate:

- Literate scientific writing
- Embedded computation
- Static publishing via GitHub Pages

## A tiny computation

Below is a Python block that runs during render.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine wave")
plt.show()
